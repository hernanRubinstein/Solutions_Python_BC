# The code purpose is to give back the most differentialy expressed genes between the groups of two samples

The files within this folder are two raw UMI matrices "mat_1" and "mat_2":
    where in the columns are color code (hex - RGB) and in rows names of genes.
    mat_1 represent the samples control and mat_2 the samples after treatment

The test, here named test_assignment_6 asserts the validitiy of the output of assignment_6 code using two 2X2 mock matrices named mat_test_1/2
